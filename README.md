# Deep Gradient Learning for Efficient Camouflaged Object Detection (Supplementary Material)
Anonymous CVPR 2022 submission
Paper ID 2241

PyTorch implementation of our Deep Gradient Network (DGNet).

## 1. Note

This repository is code used for the model of our proposed method, 
termed Deep Gradient Network (DGNet), 
which is written by PyTorch deep learning toolbox with python interface. 
Limited by the maximum size (100 MB) of supplementary materials, 
we can not upload the pretrained weight file (*.pth). 
Thus, we provide a simple-to-use demo for reviewers in our supplementary materials.  
We will release our training/inference code in the camera-ready phase. Please enjoy it!

## 2. Inference

1. Inference Configuration:

    + Run `bash inference.sh` to create a virtual environment and install necessary packages for inference.  
    
    + Just enjoy it!
